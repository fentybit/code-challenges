 # JavaScript Functions

## Part 1: Conceptual questions
1. What do we mean when we say functions are first-class objects?
    JS functions can stored either in variable or arrays. 
    JS can also return function from function.
    JS function can be passed as an argument. 

2. What is function scope and how does the scope chain work?
    In the block of a function, you can always access any scope chain reference outside of the scope block. 
    You can only refer to its outside lexical environment for the scope block's execution context. 

3. What is pass-by-value vs pass-by-reference and which rule applies to objects?
    pass-by-value, duplicate of memory.
    a = 3;
    b = a;

    pass-by-reference, same address in memory, including objects.
    c = { wayne: "new orleans" };
    d = c;

## Part 2: Coding Challenge - Build some Functions
* If you built a Plant API for your last challenge, copy those files to this directory and edit the index.js file. If not,  add the seeds from this repository (https://github.com/allisonkadel/code-challenges/tree/master/JavaScript/building-apis) and create an API with json-server (https://github.com/typicode/json-server). Then create a new index.js file.
1. Build a function that takes the plants json data from a get request to /plants and title-cases the entire name of each plant (not just capitalize the first word)
2. Build a function `filterBySpeciesPlants` that takes in plants json data and a species name and returns only those including that species name
3. Build a function `alphabetizePlants` that takes in plants json data and returns the plants sorted alphabetically by name
4. Build a function `randomizePlants` that takes in plants json data and a nunber and returns a random set of that number of plants
5. Build a higher order function that takes in any of the above functions as a callback, a number, and any other necessary optional arguments, and returns a *function* which invokes the callback with the arguments
* Test these functions out in existing or new api call responses

## BONUS: encapsulate this new functionality using the module pattern
* We know functions are just objects. Group the above functions you wrote into a module-like object.
1. Create an object with the property names equal to the function names and the values equal to an *anonymous* function
2. Wrap this object inside an immediately invoked function expression (return the object in the body of the function)
3. Assign this IIFE to a variable
4. Refactor your function invocations to avoid getting ReferenceErrors
